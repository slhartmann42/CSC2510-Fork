My favorite animal is the hillstream loach. The hillstream loach is a small freshwater fish that looks like a small ray.
I have about 60 of them in my 125 gallon aquarium on acount of the five I started with breeding. The lath onto plants and the glass
to clean the algae growing on them. The variety I have are reticulated with a mottled green pattern on an offwhite base color.
